This repository contains a fertility analysis system implemented with various machine learning algorithms. The system leverages data stored in MongoDB and uses Python libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and XGBoost to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate their performance. The algorithms used include Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Naive Bayes, Isolation Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine, and Random Forest Classifier. The code demonstrates data fetching, preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and anomaly detection to provide insights into fertility-related data.
